<p><B>Skiing</B><p>

<P>One of my favorite hobbies is skiing. I do not enjoy winter and wish I lived somewhere we did not get snow but since that's not the case I figure I'll take advantage of the weather. Coming from Mass to Maine makes it more convenient for me to go ski because its closer.<P>

<p><B>Golf</B><p>

<P>My entire life I have been involved in golf. My dad has been golfing for years and would always take me. I am not to bad at it so I enjoy going. My dad named me after Colin Montomgery.<P>
